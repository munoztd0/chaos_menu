### Ingredients
- [ ] Potatoes — 700 g (4–5 medium), waxy or all-purpose
- [ ] Eggs — 6 large
- [ ] Olive oil — 200 ml
- [ ] Onion — 150 g, thinly sliced (optional)

---

### Pan
- [ ] Non-stick pan — 24 cm diameter

---

### Method (with temperature control)

#### Potatoes (confited, not fried)
1. Put sliced potatoes (and onion) in a pan/pot with olive oil so they are mostly submerged.
2. Heat on **low** until you see **gentle, small bubbles** (no sizzling, no browning).
3. Keep at **low to low-medium** for 20–30 minutes, stirring carefully, until potatoes are very soft.
4. If you hear frying noise or see color, lower heat immediately.
5. Drain in a colander 5 minutes. Reserve the oil.

#### Egg mixture (thicken it so flipping is clean)
6. Beat eggs lightly.
7. Mix in warm (not hot) potatoes.
8. Rest **10 minutes** so the mixture thickens.

#### First side (set the “skin” without cooking the center)
9. Heat 2–3 tbsp reserved oil in the 24 cm pan on **medium-low** for 1 minute.
10. Pour mixture in and level. Keep at **medium-low**.
11. For the first 2 minutes, run a spatula around the edge and shake the pan so it doesn’t stick.
12. Cook **5–7 minutes** total.
13. Temperature cue: edges should be set and pulling slightly from the pan; the center should still wobble but **not pour**.
14. If the center is too liquid at 5 minutes, stay on **low** and give it **1–2 more minutes**.

#### Flip + slide back (avoid the messy stage)
15. Turn heat **off**.
16. Place a flat plate larger than the pan on top, flip in one motion.
17. Put pan back on the stove (heat still off), add **½ tbsp** reserved oil if pan looks dry.
18. Hold pan at **30–45°** with rim touching the plate and let tortilla **slide by gravity** back into the pan.
19. When half is in, level the pan and remove the plate.

#### Second side (seal only)
20. Turn heat to **low**.
21. Cook **45–90 seconds**.
22. Slide out immediately.

### Heat settings (most common failure points)
- Potatoes: **low** (gentle bubbling, never sizzling)
- First side: **medium-low** (set a base without tightening the eggs)
- Second side: **low** (just seal)

---

### Doneness target
- If it breaks when flipping: first side was **too raw** → extend first side 60–120 seconds on low.
- If it’s dry: heat was **too high** on first side or second side cooked too long.
